            "Chisinau accuses Moscow of undermining democratic process and condemned drones flown over its territory. Moldova has handed a note of protest to the Russian ambassador to Chisinau over alleged interference in its recent elections. The foreign ministry in Chisinau said in a statement on Tuesday that it turned over the \u201cnote of firm protest\u201d in relation to the \u201cillegal and deliberate interference\u201d to envoy Oleg Ozerov during a meeting at its offices. Moldova has accused Russia of seeking to influence its recent presidential election and referendum on joining the European Union.     Russia sought to affect results and delegitimise the democratic process, the ministry complained. Chisinau accused Russia of organising ineligible voting, bribery, and security threats in a bid to influence the votes. Moscow denies trying to sway the election, which was narrowly won by pro-Western President Maia Sandu, aided by votes from Moldovans outside the country. Moldova also narrowly voted in favour of inserting a clause in its constitution to define EU membership as a goal. Russia has maintained that the votes were unfair and does not view Sandu as the legitimate president. The pivot toward the West by Moldova, formerly part of the Soviet Union, has led to worsening relations with Russia in recent years. The European bloc, along with the United States, have backed Moldova\u2019s assertions that Russia tried to interfere in the country\u2019s elections. Moldova\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reported that it used the meeting to strongly condemn a violation of its air space by two alleged Russian drones on Sunday. \u201cThe competent institutions of our country possess clear information indicating that the drones were launched by the Russian Federation,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cThe ambassador was warned that such aggressive incursions constitute a serious violation and an unfriendly act by the Russian Federation, as these drones endanger the lives of citizens.\u201d Ozerov denied he had been summoned by the ministry, suggesting that the meeting was mutually agreed. \u201cThe conversation made it possible to clarify issues related to our acute and complex bilateral relations,\u201d the Russian ambassador said. Ozerov said there was no evidence the drones were Russian and that Moscow did not fly drones through countries neighbouring Ukraine. No casualties were reported after Moldova said it found two Russian \u201cdecoy\u201d drones crashed in two villages after a Russian drone attack on Ukraine.     ",
            "Former prime minister Navin Ramgoolam has won a third term in the Indian Ocean nation, official results show. Opposition leader Navin Ramgoolam has won a landslide victory in Mauritius\u2019s parliamentary vote, the election commission said. The Office of the Electoral Commissioner said on Tuesday that Rangoolam and his Alliance of Change (ADC) coalition won 62.6 percent of the vote, securing the three-time former prime minister a fourth term.     The ADC won 60 of 62 seats in the National Assembly, state broadcaster Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation reported. \u201cThe court of the people has delivered its verdict and a new Mauritius awakes,\u201d 77-year-old Rangoolam said to crowds of supporters amid boisterous cheers and blaring horns. Ramgoolam served as prime minister from 1995 to 2000 and again from 2005 to 2014. As well as the 60 seats for Mauritius, there were two up for grabs for the island of Rodrigues and another eight allocated under what is dubbed the \u201cbest loser\u201d system. The winner-takes-all election model means single coalitions often dominate parliament. Incumbent Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth had conceded on Monday that his Lepep alliance, led by his Militant Socialist Movement (MSM), was \u201cheading towards a huge defeat\u201d. \u201cThe people have chosen another team to lead the country,\u201d Jugnauth, who has served as prime minister since 2017, told reporters. Only last month, the 62-year-old prime minister was celebrating a historic deal that saw Britain cede sovereignty over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius after a long-running dispute. But the vote was overshadowed by an explosive wire-tapping scandal, when secretly recorded phone calls of politicians, diplomats, members of civil society and journalists were leaked online. Ramgoolam said that following his landslide victory, he would first dismantle the country\u2019s \u201cspying system so that Mauritians will be free to talk\u201d. During the campaign, both camps promised to improve the lot of Mauritians who face cost-of-living difficulties despite robust economic growth. Measures outlined in the Alliance of Change manifesto include the creation of a fund to support families facing hardship, free public transport, increased pensions and reduced fuel prices, as well as efforts to tackle corruption and boost the green economy. It also called for constitutional and electoral reforms including changing how the president and parliament speaker are chosen. At least one million people were registered to vote on Sunday in the 12th election since Mauritius gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1968. Mauritius, which sits about 2,000km (1,240 miles) off Africa\u2019s east coast, is recognised as one of the continent\u2019s most stable democracies and has developed a successful economy underpinned by its finance, tourism and agricultural sectors since gaining independence. Both Jugnauth and Ramgoolam are members of the dynasties that have dominated the leadership of Mauritius since independence. Ramgoolam, who previously worked as a doctor and a lawyer, is the son of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, who led Mauritius to independence from Britain.     ",

            "Japanese voters go to the polls after new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called a snap election. The outcome could strengthen him, or further weaken the governing LDP. Voters in Japan head to the polls on Sunday to elect members of their House of Representatives in an election seen as a test for the country\u2019s new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. With Ishiba\u2019s governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) embroiled in scandals and facing diminishing public support, the vote is expected to present the party with its toughest electoral challenge in more than a decade.     While the result may be seen as a measure of public endorsement of or displeasure with Ishiba, the election is not likely to see his LDP \u2013 which has maintained a tight grip on power in Japan since 1955 \u2013 fall too far from its pedestal. Analysts expect the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ) to gain significant ground, but not enough to change the government. The LDP, they predict, may lose a few dozen seats. But even in a worst-case scenario, the party will still likely be number one in the ruling bloc. Here\u2019s what you should know about Japan\u2019s election: The LDP has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war era and holds a majority in the 465-seat lower house. The LDP\u2019s longtime coalition partner is Komeito, a party backed by a large Buddhist group that has often lent crucial campaign support to its political partner. Formed in 1955 and credited with leading Japan\u2019s economic recovery after World War II, the LDP\u2019s rule was interrupted twice, in 1993-1994 and 2009-2012. In both times, bribery scandals rocked the party and its public support. Now the LDP\u2019s popularity has hit a low again. A recent poll by Japan\u2019s Asahi newspaper showed the LDP may struggle in the election, potentially losing 50 of the 247 seats it now has in parliament. The main opposition CDPJ is making inroads, with the Asahi poll estimating it could grab as many as 140 seats in the election, up from its current 98. If that happens, the new prime minister\u2019s calling of this snap election will have backfired. Other surveys portend bad news for the LDP too. According to the Pew Research Centre, just 30 percent of Japanese people surveyed in March had a favourable view of the LDP, with 68 percent holding an unfavourable view. But the opposition did not fare any better in the public\u2019s opinion, with just 29 percent of those surveyed holding a positive view of the CDPJ, according to Pew. More concerning, only a third of those surveyed by Pew were satisfied with \u201cthe way democracy was working\u201d in Japan. Ishiba dissolved parliament and called an election shortly after taking over as prime minister on October 1, when he replaced the LDP\u2019s outgoing and embattled premier Fumio Kishida. Craig Mark, adjunct professor at Hosei University in Tokyo, said Ishiba called the election a year before one was required under Japan\u2019s constitution in order to catch the opposition \u201coff guard and secure a more solid mandate to pursue his policy agenda\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s banking on the public rallying behind a new face and image for his party, following the unpopularity of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida,\u201d Mark wrote in The Conversation magazine. Kishida\u2019s popularity had plummeted amid a\u00a0major corruption scandal\u00a0involving unreported political funds.      The opposition CDPJ, Mark said, is also hoping to increase its vote by projecting \u201can image of reliability and stability\u201d. \u201cIshiba\u2019s challenge in this early election is not only to win enough votes to retain government, but to be electorally successful enough to hold off his rivals from the conservative wing of the LDP,\u201d Mark added. The Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL) has described the election as \u201ccrucial\u201d for the LDP and Ishiba, in terms of gauging public trust following recent scandals and mounting economic concerns. \u201cIt will serve as a critical indicator of whether the LDP can regain public trust and retain its dominance or if opposition parties can capitalise on public dissatisfaction,\u201d ANFREL said. Polling stations open at 7am Sunday (22:00 GMT Saturday) and voting ends at 8pm (11:00 GMT) on Sunday, with results filtering in later in the night and continuing into the early morning. Vote counting in Japan\u2019s elections is generally conducted quickly, said Rob Fahey of The Waseda Institute for Advanced Study in Tokyo, and results will likely be announced on Sunday night, with only some seats \u2013 those that require recounts or involve other issues \u2013 being announced on Monday. If the LDP is unable to retain its poll position in the ruling coalition, questions will be asked of Ishiba\u2019s leadership, raising the spectre of continuing political instability in Japan at a time of economic uncertainty and a challenging foreign relations environment. Analysts, in particular, point to the health of Japan\u2019s defensive capabilities amid growing regional tension with nearby China, Russia and North Korea.      On the other hand, if the likely reduction in LDP seats \u201cis as small as possible\u201d, Ishiba will strengthen his standing in the party by having delivered a positive election result and will be recognised as the \u201cprime minister who has the public\u2019s support\u201d, said Kazuto Suzuki, associate fellow at the Asia-Pacific Programme of Chatham House. \u201cIf Ishiba can create a secure base of government, Japanese politics will be stabilized and Japan\u2019s foreign and security policies, which were strengthened by the Abe and Kishida administrations, can continue to be bolstered,\u201d Suzuki wrote in an analysis brief earlier this month.",

            "Here is an hour by hour breakdown of when the polls will open and close during the 2024 US general election. Harris campaign rallies key swing states, confident of momentum as polls show gains in battlegrounds Millions of Americans will head to polling booths on Tuesday to cast their ballots in the 2024 presidential election, in which Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, are locked in a tight race. There are 230 million eligible voters, but only about 160 million of them are registered. Nearly half of the 50 states in the United States, however, allow on-the-day registration while citizens can vote without registering in North Dakota.     More than 70 million people have already voted through postal ballots or at early in-person polling stations. Voters will also elect 34 US senators (out of 100) and all 435 members for the US House of Representatives. Additionally, gubernatorial races will take place in 11 states and two territories (Puerto Rico and American Samoa). The US stretches across six time zones. Using US East Coast time (ET), voting will start as early as 5am (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday and go as late as 1am (06:00 GMT) on Wednesday. We break down when polls open and close across the states: Polls open at different times from state to state. The earliest voting will start well before dawn in some municipalities in Vermont. Polls open in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Virginia. Some polls in Indiana and Kentucky also open. In Maine, polls open from 6am ET to 10am ET (15:00 GMT) depending on the municipality guidelines. In New Hampshire, polls open from 6am ET to 11am ET (16:00 GMT). Polls open in the battleground state of North Carolina as well as the red states of Ohio and West Virginia. States that traditionally back Republicans are called red states. Polls open in Delaware, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Carolina. Some polls in Indiana, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky and Michigan also open at this time. In Tennessee, voting starts from 7am ET to 10am ET (15:00 GMT) depending on the municipality. Georgia is a critical swing state. In the 2020 election, Democrat Joe Biden won by 0.2 percentage points over Trump, making it the narrowest margin of victory that year. From 1972 to 2016, Republican candidates would usually sweep Georgia. However, races have become tighter in the state recently due to demographic changes. Polls open in Alabama, Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Wisconsin. Some polls in Florida, Kansas, Michigan, South Dakota and Texas also open at this time. In North Dakota, voting starts from 8am ET to 11am ET (15:00 GMT) depending on the municipality. Arizona recently became a swing state when Biden defeated Trump by 0.3 percentage points four years ago. From 1952 to 2016, the Republican presidential candidate won in Arizona with one exception \u2013 Democrat Bill Clinton when he ran against Republican Robert Dole in 1996. Arkansas starts voting. People start casting ballots in Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. Polls also open at this time in some parts of South Dakota, Oregon and Texas and for the New Shoreham municipality in Rhode Island. In Idaho, polls open from 9am ET to 11am ET (16:00 GMT) depending on the municipality. Voting starts in California and Nevada as well as some parts of Oregon. In Washington, polls open from 10am ET to noon ET (17:00 GMT) depending on the municipality. Some polls open in Alaska, a state with two time zones. The state\u2019s other polls open at noon ET (17:00 GMT) Polls open in Hawaii. Some polls in Indiana and Kentucky close. Polls close in six states: Georgia, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and the remainder of Indiana and Kentucky. Trump disputed the 2020 Georgia election result. He was later indicted on charges of election interference there. False claims about election fraud in the swing state in this election are already circulating. Indiana, Kentucky and South Carolina are leaning towards Trump while Virginia and Vermont are expected to go to Harris. Polls close in Ohio, North Carolina and West Virginia. In 2020 in North Carolina, Trump won the battleground state by 1.3 percentage points over Biden, and in 2016, Trump won the state by 3.6 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton. From 1980 to 2020, Republicans have won in North Carolina in every election except 2008 when Democrat Barack Obama won against John McCain by 0.3 percentage points. Ohio and West Virginia have historically voted Republican, and a Trump win is expected in the two states. Polls close in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington and the District of Columbia. Most polls in Michigan and Texas also close at this time. Pennsylvania is a swing state that Biden won by 1.2 percentage points in 2020. In 2016, Trump won against Clinton by 0.7 percentage points. After a Democratic win in 1976, Republicans swept the state from 1980 to 1988. From 1992 to 2012, Democrats won Pennsylvania. Polls close in Arkansas, marking a conclusion of voting in half of the US states. Arkansas is expected to go to Trump because Republicans have won comfortably in the state from 2000 to 2020. Polls close in 15 states: Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming. These include three swing states: Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin. From 1976 to 2020, Republicans have won in Arizona every election except 1996 and 2020. In 2020, Biden beat Trump by 0.3 percentage points. In 2016, Trump beat Clinton by 3.6 percentage points. From 1992 to 2020, Michigan has swung blue for Democrats every election except 2016 when Trump beat Clinton by 0.2 percentage points. In 2020, Biden beat Trump in the state by 2.8 percentage points. But US support for Israel\u2019s war on Gaza could turn the sizeable number of Arab American voters in the state towards Trump or the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein. Wisconsin has also historically turned blue, doing so in every election from 1988 to 2020 except in 2016 when Trump defeated Clinton by 0.7 percentage points. In 2020, Biden won the state by 0.7 percentage points. Polls close in Montana, Nevada and Utah. Montana and Utah are expected to go to Trump. Nevada, however, is a swing state. While Republicans won the state from 1976 to 1988, Democrats have won there since 2008. In 2020, Biden won by 2.4 percentage points. In 2016, Clinton beat Trump by 2.4 percentage points. Polls close in California, Idaho, Oregon and Washington. California is the most populous US state, and it is expected to go to Harris, who is from California and has represented the state in the US Senate and served as its attorney general. From 1992 to 2020, Democrats have won comfortably in California. Oregon and Washington are also likely to see a Harris victory while Idaho is expected to go to Trump. Polls close in Hawaii and parts of Alaska. Trump is expected to win in Alaska while Harris is expected to win in Hawaii. The final polls close in Alaska\u2019s Aleutian Islands.",

            "State prosecutors say probe comes at request of electoral commission as they summon President Salome Zourabichvili who alleges Russian interference. State prosecutors in Georgia say they have launched an investigation into opposition allegations of \u201cfalsification\u201d in recent parliamentary elections won by the governing Georgian Dream party. The prosecutor\u2019s office said in a statement on Wednesday that it has also summoned President Salome Zourabichvili, who has repeatedly said the vote count was falsified.     The European Union criticised \u201cirregularities\u201d in Saturday\u2019s vote and called for an investigation. United States President Joe Biden said he was \u201cdeeply alarmed\u201d by democratic \u201cbacksliding\u201d in the country. The electoral commission announced that Georgian Dream won with 54 percent of the vote, amid protests from the pro-Western opposition that denounced the election as a \u201cconstitutional coup\u201d. The prosecutor\u2019s office said the investigation was being opened at the request of the electoral commission, which had previously said that the election was free and fair. Zourabichvili, who \u201cis believed to possess evidence regarding possible falsification \u2026 has been summoned to the investigative agency for an interview\u201d on Thursday, it added.      Zourabichvili declared the election results \u201cillegitimate\u201d, alleging election interference by a \u201cRussian special operation\u201d, a claim that was rejected by the Kremlin. Election observers, including from the 57-nation Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), have said that the vote was marred by incidents of voter intimidation, bribery and ballot stuffing that could have affected the result, but stopped short of calling it rigged. Georgian media on Tuesday reported that the electoral commission called the allegations of fraud \u201cbaseless criticism\u201d. The commission said, however, that it would conduct a recount at a small number of randomly selected polling stations. Tens of thousands of people rallied in the capital, Tbilisi, on Monday to protest against the results, which showed Georgian Dream won 1.12 million votes, 335,000 more than the four main opposition parties combined, which received about 37 percent of votes. Opposition parties have said they would not enter the new \u201cillegitimate\u201d parliament and demanded \u201cfresh\u201d elections run by an \u201cinternational election administration\u201d. Tbilisi has been rocked by protests this year over several repressive laws passed by Georgian Dream, with opponents accusing the party of steering the Caucasus country towards Russia. The election was cast as a choice between a party that has deepened ties with Russia, and an opposition that had hoped to fast-track integration with the EU. The 27-nation European bloc froze Georgia\u2019s accession process after Georgian Dream passed a law this year on \u201cforeign influence\u201d that opponents say mirrors Russian legislation.",

            "Lee Jae-myung says he will appeal the court\u2019s decision, which could bar him from running for president in 2027. South Korea\u2019s main opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, has been convicted on charges of violating the country\u2019s election law and handed a one-year suspended prison sentence. The Seoul Central District Court on Friday found the leader of the Democratic Party (DP) guilty of making false statements before the 2022 presidential election in violation of the Public Official Election Act.     If upheld, the ruling will strip Lee of his parliamentary seat and bar him from running in the next presidential election in 2027, as the law prohibits him from running for public office for the next five years. Lee\u00a0said after the hearing that he would appeal the court\u2019s decision. \u201cI will be appealing. Beginning with the basic facts, it is a conclusion that is difficult to accept,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere are still two more courts left in the real world, and the courts of public opinion and history are eternal,\u201d he said, apparently referring to plans to take the case to the Supreme Court. Lee\u2019s supporters and critics occupied separate streets near the court, shouting opposing slogans and holding signs that said \u201cLee Jae-myung is innocent\u201d and \u201cArrest Lee Jae-myung\u201d. Lee, who narrowly lost to President Yoon Suk-yeol in the 2022 election, faces at least four trials after being indicted on several criminal charges including bribery and corruption. Yoon is also facing a string of controversies, including allegations of influence-peddling alongside his wife. In the ruling on Friday, the court found that Lee breached election law by making false statements as a presidential candidate in 2021 that he was not acquainted with a city official who was in charge of a development project.      The official in question was the late Kim Moon-ki, a former executive of Seongnam Development Corporation, which was behind a corruption-ridden development project in Seongnam, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap. Lee was also accused of making a false claim during a parliamentary audit in 2021 about a land development project in Seongnam where he served as mayor. Lee was the mayor of Seongnam from 2010 to 2018 before becoming governor of Gyeonggi province and a member of parliament. Lee, who is widely expected to run in the 2027 election, survived a knife attack in January when he was stabbed\u00a0in the neck by a man during an event and underwent surgery.

            "More than a month after a disputed election, protests still roil the country, taking innovative forms, even as shutdowns bleed the economy. Maputo, Mozambique \u2013 At 7pm on November 4, Maputo\u2019s streets fell into an eerie silence. Public transportation was at a standstill, adhering to opposition leader Venancio Mondlane\u2019s call for a shutdown.     Then, a steady clanging began. Residents in affluent high rises and inner-city apartment blocks alike joined in a coordinated chorus of a pot-banging protest. Known as a \u201cpanelaco\u201d, this form of protest has emerged as a powerful way to voice frustrations over Mozambique\u2019s disputed general election results, allowing citizens to express dissent without facing the immediate risk of police retaliation. The clatter and clang echoed across the city\u2019s skyline, marking the start of what would become nightly expressions of frustration, uniting residents across class divides. Since the October 9 elections, the declaration of the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo) presidential candidate Daniel Chapo as the winner has sparked intense discontent. According to the National Election Commission (CNE), Chapo received 71 percent of the vote and Mondlane, an independent candidate, received 20 percent. Yet even the CNE admitted to \u201cseveral irregularities\u201d, leading the Constitutional Council to review the election\u2019s integrity. Mondlane outright rejected the results and proclaimed himself the legitimate winner. Days later on October 19, his attorney Elvino Dias was assassinated, further intensifying public anger over the election results, which many voters do not believe. Dias, a pivotal figure in the legal team challenging the official results, was preparing a case alleging electoral fraud. Over the ensuing weeks, Maputo witnessed a series of protests \u2014 pot-clanging shows of dissent at night but also calls from Mondlane urging demonstrators to shut down economically vital locations, from Maputo to provincial capitals, ports and key border crossings. Workers were encouraged to stay away from work, businesses were closed and people gathered to protest in cities across the country. These calls for intensified shutdowns have turned deadly in several regions. NGOs reported that at least 30 people have been killed since the protests began, including in violent confrontations with police. The unrest has impacted regional trade, most notably at the Lebombo border post with South Africa, which was temporarily closed due to demonstrations in the nearby town of Ressano Garcia, disrupting a critical route for goods and commuters. Environmental engineering student Henrique Amilcar Calioio joined protests in Maputo, where young people chanted \u201cpower to the people\u201d in Portuguese and were met with tear gas from the police. \u201cDespite not causing any harm or damage, we had to disperse,\u201d he said. Calioio subsequently joined in the nightly protests and banged pots and pans as a way of crying out against what he calls an oppressive government. \u201cIt was inspiring to hear people come together for a greater cause,\u201d he told Al Jazeera of the panelaco protests. He said the banging of the pots represents the \u201cvoice of the voiceless\u201d. One evening during the coordinated pot banging, police vehicles drove past the building where Calioio lives and sprayed tear gas that entered homes, including Calioio\u2019s, leaving him in extreme pain. \u201cIt is shocking that even in our homes, we are forbidden from protesting,\u201d he said. Shireen Mohammed*, a schoolteacher in Maputo, accused the police of being \u201cvery, very heavy-handed\u201d. She described her daily commutes between home and work under the shadow of military vehicles and police trucks stationed along the city\u2019s main routes. On days when protesters heed Mondlane\u2019s calls for nationwide shutdowns, she is forced to teach her classes online although this has been challenging due to periodic internet and social media blackouts enforced by the government. Phone signals have also been intermittently interrupted. \u201cThe previous days were chaos,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI could hear gunshots going off. It was crazy. And what frustrates me is that we can\u2019t even communicate. I couldn\u2019t use my phone to call anyone. You can\u2019t tell your family you\u2019re OK.\u201d Mohammed said the protests and the response of Mozambicans \u2013 especially the seeming adherence of people to Mondlane\u2019s calls for nationwide shutdowns \u2013 are evidence that the formal election results were dubious. \u201cEverybody does what Mondlane says,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question on everyone\u2019s lips is, if he got only 20 percent and Frelimo won with 70 percent, how come everyone is following what he says?\u201d Sam Jones, a senior research fellow at the World Institute for Development Economics Research, a part of the United Nations University, believes the protests have deeper socioeconomic roots beyond a single election. \u201cMozambique has been plagued by economic stagnation, and people are frustrated,\u201d Jones explained. \u201cThere\u2019s a cumulative sense that the country is not on the right path. We\u2019ve had 10 years of almost no economic growth, and there is strong disenchantment with the ruling elite. Mondlane has managed to effectively connect with young people, mobilising them in a way we haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d In response, Bernardino Rafael, commander of the Police of the Republic of Mozambique, has condemned the protests as \u201curban terrorism\u201d, alleging that their intent is to destabilise the constitutional order. Yet many view the government\u2019s response as disproportionately aggressive. For Mohammed, the scenes of unrest have a haunting familiarity. Her parents fled Mozambique more than 30 years ago to escape its civil war, and now she fears similar violence may once again engulf her homeland. Jones said the state\u2019s response has only intensified the conflict. \u201cThe police have responded forcefully with tear gas, rubber bullets and even live ammunition. In many cases, the violence has stemmed from the brutal responses by security forces, which has only deepened the resentment among protesters.\u201d The protracted unrest has begun to impact food supplies in Maputo in a country that depends heavily on imports from South Africa. \u201cThere\u2019s anxiety around food shortages because the border region has experienced protests and even border closures on multiple occasions,\u201d Jones said. Siphiwe Nyanda, South Africa\u2019s high commissioner to Mozambique, acknowledged the cross-border strain, noting that grocery stores in Maputo have experienced shortages directly due to protest-related supply chain disruptions. \u201cIt\u2019s causing serious problems for both Mozambique and South Africa, especially border towns reliant on trade,\u201d he said, adding that the Lebombo border, one of the busiest in the region, serves as a crucial trade route. \u201cThe protests have created a ripple effect that impacts not only local economies but also commuters and daily life in places like [the South African border town] Komatipoort, which depends on Mozambican workers and trade.\u201d The ongoing crisis has reportedly led to economic losses estimated at 10 million rand ($550,000) per day for South Africa, according to Gavin Kelly, CEO of the South African Road Freight Association. In Mozambique, more than 150 shops have been vandalised with damage estimated at $369m, further compounding the economic turmoil. Now, the Southern African Development Community, the 16-nation regional bloc, has scheduled an emergency summit in Harare on Saturday to address the crisis. Back in Maputo, though, Jones believes the protests have taken on a life of their own \u2014 their scale and persistence unusual for Mozambique and an indication of an anger that politicians and diplomats in the country and the region won\u2019t be able to quell easily. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen postelection protests before, but they\u2019ve rarely been this sustained. Typically, after a few days, people get tired, especially when it feels like nothing will change,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time, the participation has been broader and more intense, reflecting not just election grievances but deeper dissatisfaction with the status quo.\u201d *Name changed to protect identity, amid fears of harassment",
            "In Pictures Scuffles broke out in Georgia\u2019s capital as police broke up a camp set up in protest against the disputed results of last month\u2019s parliamentary election. Police moved in to remove the camp, which blocked a main thoroughfare in the capital, Tbilisi, before dawn on Tuesday. Thousands of people later returned to re-establish the camp. The round-the-clock protest was spurred by the October 26 election that saw the governing Georgian Dream party remain in power. Opponents say the vote was rigged and suspect neighbouring Russia\u2019s influence. Many Georgians viewed the election as a referendum on the country\u2019s effort to join the European Union. Several protesters were detained as police moved to disperse the camp, according to The Associated Press news agency. Some demonstrators displayed EU flags. Up to 1,000 protesters remained at the site, and the crowd swelled to several thousand in the evening. Demonstrators again set up camp in the area. Elene Khoshtaria, leader of Coalition for Change, which unites several opposition parties, said the demonstrations would continue. \u201cThere was absolutely no reason for dispersal, but it will not stop our resistance. It\u2019s their mistake, their weakness, and they will pay the price for it. We will continue to resist as long as it takes,\u201d she said. President Salome Zourabichvili, who has rejected the official results, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday at the constitutional court, arguing that two fundamental principles guaranteed by the constitution \u2013 the secrecy of the vote and its universality \u2013 were violated. Zourabichvili, who holds a mostly ceremonial position, has said Georgia has fallen victim to pressure from Moscow against joining the EU. Critics have accused Georgian Dream \u2013 established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia \u2013 of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted towards Moscow. The party recently\u00a0pushed through laws\u00a0similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The EU suspended Georgia\u2019s membership application process indefinitely in June, after the country\u2019s parliament passed a law requiring organisations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cpursuing the interest of a foreign power\u201d. The legislation is similar to a Russian law used to discredit organisations critical of the government. The Central Election Commission said Georgian Dream won about 54 percent of the vote. The party\u2019s leaders have rejected opposition claims of fraud. European election observers said the election took place in a \u201cdivisive\u201d atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence.",

            "Opposition leader Navin Ramgoolam looks set to take over the post of prime minister for a third time. Pravind Jugnauth, the incumbent prime minister of Mauritius, has conceded defeat in the parliamentary election, saying his political alliance is headed for a major loss. \u201cL\u2019Alliance Lepep is heading towards a huge defeat. I have tried to do what I can for the country and the population. The population has decided to choose another team. I wish good luck to the country,\u201d Jugnauth, serving as prime minister since 2017, told reporters on Monday.     Final results have yet to be officially released, but opposition leader Navin Ramgoolam looks set to take over as prime minister for the third time at the head of his Alliance of Change coalition. Voters went to the polls on Sunday to elect legislators for the 62 seats in parliament for the next five years, from a list of 68 parties and five political alliances. The party or coalition to receive more than half the seats in parliament will also win the prime minister\u2019s post.      Only last month, Jugnauth, 62, was celebrating a historic deal with the United Kingdom to regain sovereignty over the Chagos Islands following a long-running dispute. But the campaign was overshadowed by an explosive wire-tapping scandal, when secretly recorded phone calls of politicians, diplomats and journalists were leaked online. During a sometimes-heated campaign, both camps promised voters they would take measures to improve the lives of Mauritians who face cost-of-living difficulties despite strong economic growth. Turnout in Sunday\u2019s vote was strong at about 80 percent, according to provisional estimates by the election commission. Sixty-two seats were up for grabs under a first-past-the-post system, with the remaining eight allocated under what is dubbed the \u201cbest loser\u201d system. Voters had voiced concern about the continued political and economic durability of one of the richest and most stable democracies in Africa. Both Jugnauth and Ramgoolam are members of the dynasties that have dominated politics in Mauritius since it became independent from the UK in 1968. Ramgoolam, 77, is the son of Seewoosagur Ramgoolam \u2013 who led Mauritius to independence \u2013 and served as prime minister between 1995 and 2000 and again from 2005 to 2014. On Sunday, he had voiced optimism that his bloc would win. \u201cWe are heading towards a big victory tomorrow. The people are waiting for this liberation,\u201d he told reporters. The majority-Hindu nation has seen substantial stability and growth since independence, building an economy based on tourism as well as financial services and textile manufacturing. Gross domestic product per capita in 2022 was more than $10,000, according to the World Bank. But analysts have highlighted growing concerns about governance and corruption. The island is renowned for its spectacular palm-fringed white beaches and turquoise waters, attracting 1.3 million visitors last year.",
            "The president says Chinese research vessels keep coming to Palau\u2019s waters. The pro-Western president of Palau has hit out at China as his re-election was confirmed. The electoral committee formally declared President Surangel Whipps Jr\u2019s victory in the vote on Wednesday. He was quick to double down on his pro-US credentials as he joined the chorus of complaints over China\u2019s maritime claims.     The results showed that Whipps won 5,626 votes, defeating his brother-in-law Tommy Remengesau, who received 4,103 votes in the November 5 election. The count hands the incumbent a second term leading the island nation of about 20,000 people. Located in the Pacific Ocean between the spheres of influence of Washington and Beijing, Palau is an important US ally and among a dozen diplomatic allies of Taiwan. On having his victory confirmed, Whipps said in a statement he would seek to diversify the economy and protect the environment. Palau this year renewed a deal with Washington that will see it receive $890m in economic assistance in return for allowing continued US military access to its maritime zone, airspace and land. In comments to the AFP news agency, Whipps reiterated accusations against China of disregarding the island nation\u2019s maritime borders. Referring to Chinese research vessels lurking \u201cuninvited\u201d within Palau\u2019s waters, he said: \u201cThey continually don\u2019t respect our sovereignty and our boundaries.\u201d He added that Chinese authorities have named two underwater mountains claimed by Palau, in what is viewed as another provocative move. Palau is also \u201cconcerned,\u201d he said, about confrontations between vessels from China and the Philippines over shoals in the South China Sea. During his first term, Whipps repeatedly said \u201cpresence is deterrence\u201d in reference to increased US military presence in Palau, and characterized the Pacific Island country as \u201cpart of the US homeland\u201d when it comes to security. The military collaboration has included ongoing construction of a long-range US radar outpost, a crucial early warning system as China ramps up military manoeuvres in the Taiwan Strait. Increasingly pivoting away from China, the island nation is also one of few to recognise Taiwan\u2019s independence, leading Beijing to blacklist Palau as a tourist destination, affecting its revenues from visitors.

            "President Dissanayake now has the mandate he needs to tackle corruption and recover stolen assets after financial crash. Sri Lanka elects Marxist-leaning Dissanayake as president to fix economy Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake\u2019s leftist coalition has achieved a landslide victory in snap parliamentary elections, delivering the self-described Marxist leader a powerful mandate to fight poverty and corruption in the crisis-stricken nation. The Election Commission of Sri Lanka said on Friday that Dissanayake\u2019s National People\u2019s Power (NPP) coalition secured a two-thirds majority in parliament, winning 159 of 225 seats, a huge lead on opposition alliance Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB), which won 40 seats.     Dissanayake, a 55-year-old veteran politician, was elected president on September 21 with 42 percent of the vote, in a rejection of traditional political parties that have governed the island nation since independence from British rule in 1948. His party\u2019s victory on Friday vindicated his decision to immediately call elections and secure parliamentary backing for his plans to combat corruption and recover stolen assets, two years after a financial crash led to months-long shortages of food, fuel and essential medicines. Reporting from Colombo, Al Jazeera\u2019s Minelle Fernandez said voters had said \u201cenough is enough\u201d, voting overwhelmingly \u201cto take a chance on the NPP\u201d. The vote, she said, marked a rejection of \u201cthe same old faces, the same old parties [that] have been hoodwinking us for too long now\u201d.      In July, public anger about the economic crisis culminated in the storming of then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s compound, prompting his resignation and temporary exile. The Rajapaksa clan\u2019s Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party, whose cohort of brothers gave the country two presidents during a dozen years in power and had 145 seats in the outgoing legislature, was virtually wiped out in this week\u2019s vote, winning just two seats. Dissanayake\u2019s pledge to change a \u201ccorrupt\u201d political culture had resonated with millions of Sri Lankans struggling to make ends meet following tax hikes and other austerity measures imposed to repair the nation\u2019s finances. Upon being elected president, he had promised to renegotiate a controversial $2.9bn International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout secured by his predecessor, but has since maintained the country\u2019s agreement with the lender. However, his party\u2019s newly won majority could see him reopen talks. While he was in opposition, Dissanayake argued against the enormous powers of the executive presidency and its links to abuse of power. His party\u2019s majority will now allow him to begin the process of abolishing the position, though analysts say this is unlikely to be a priority. Commenting on the coalition\u2019s majority, Al Jazeera\u2019s Fernandez said: \u201cThere are observers who say too much power is something for concern, but the president had said that \u2026 voters should fill the parliament with his representatives [who] could give effect to the change that they were promising.\u201d Dissanayake, who hails from the Sinhala-majority town of Galewela, had been an MP for nearly 25 years and was briefly an agriculture minister, but his NPP coalition held just three seats in the outgoing assembly. Marking a major shift in the country\u2019s electoral landscape, his coalition won the Jaffna district, the heartland of ethnic Tamils in the north, who have long been suspicious of Sinhalese leaders. Ethnic Tamil rebels fought an unsuccessful civil war in 1983-2009 to create a separate homeland, saying they were being marginalized by governments controlled by Sinhalese. According to conservative United Nations estimates, more than 100,000 people were killed in the conflict. Voter turnout in this week\u2019s election was estimated at less than 70 percent, below the 80 percent of eligible voters who cast a ballot in September\u2019s presidential polls.     ",
            "Head of Central Electoral Commission is doused with black paint during unruly session as protesters gathered outside. Thousands of people are protesting in Georgia after the election commission confirmed the governing party as the winner of last month\u2019s disputed parliamentary polls. The Caucasus nation\u2019s Central Electoral Commission (CEC) said on Saturday that the Russia-friendly Georgian Dream party won 53.93 percent of the vote, against 37.79 percent garnered by an alliance of pro-Western opposition groups.     The final results give Georgian Dream 89 seats in the 150-member parliament, which the opposition has refused to enter based on allegations of tampered results. During a confrontational session of the election commission, opposition representative Davit Kirtadze splashed black paint on the CEC chief, Giorgi Kalandarishvili. He shouted that the commission head has been moving Georgia towards Russia instead of the European Union. The Ministry of Internal Affairs said it has initiated a criminal investigation against Kirtadze. The ministry also said police detained three antigovernment demonstrators at a protest outside the commission\u2019s headquarters. There have been a string of protests drawing tens of thousands following the October 26 parliamentary vote.      There were mass student protests at universities on Friday evening in big cities across Georgia, including at Tbilisi State University, which lasted until after midnight. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze and the president have also been clashing, with President Salome Zourabishvili describing the vote as illegitimate and accusing Russia of interference. The EU and the United States have said the election must be investigated for \u201cirregularities\u201d. Russia has denied any meddling. Kobakhidze has insisted the elections were free and fair. He asserted that parliament would convene within 10 days after the release of the results by CEC. Last week, the prime minister threatened to ban all main opposition parties. Before the election, Brussels had warned that the vote would determine Georgia\u2019s chances of joining the EU. Georgia has been a candidate for EU membership since last year, but its internal power struggles have stalled the process. Issues such as legislation curbing LGBTQ rights and a \u201cforeign influence\u201d law to restrict NGOs and the media \u2013 which critics accused of favouring Russia \u2013 have affected the effort. Protests have also raged this week in Georgia\u2019s breakaway territory of Abkhazia over a proposed measure that would allow Russians to buy property there. On Saturday, protesters refused to leave the parliament building, which they had stormed on Friday.     ",
            "The interim leader pledges electoral and constitutional reforms before elections in an address marking 100 days in power. Bangladesh\u2018s interim leader Muhammad Yunus has appealed for the nation\u2019s \u201cpatience\u201d, pledging that general elections would be held after electoral and institutional reforms were completed in a televised address marking 100 days in office. \u201cI promise that we will hold the much-anticipated election once the necessary and essential reforms are complete,\u201d said Yunus, who was tasked with leading the transitional government following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August.     The 84-year-old leader promised that an election commission would be formed \u201cwithin a few days\u201d, but did not provide a timeline for elections, citing the need for significant electoral and constitutional reforms. \u201cI request your patience until then. We aim to build an electoral system that will endure for decades. For this, we need some time.\u201d The country\u2019s only Nobel laureate, who is renowned for his pioneering work in microfinance, Yunus has been tasked with rebuilding democratic institutions after Hasina\u2019s 15-year rule. Yunus was appointed \u201cchief adviser\u201d on August 9, following student-led protests that ended Hasina\u2019s authoritarian rule. The\u00a0deadly protests began in July after college students demanded the abolition of a controversial quota system in government jobs that they said favoured supporters of the governing party. Though Bangladesh\u2019s top court scrapped the quota, the protests soon morphed into a wider call for the removal of Hasina\u2019s \u201cautocratic\u201d regime, marked by allegations of widespread rights violations. The government\u2019s response was one of the bloodiest chapters in Bangladesh\u2019s history as security forces beat the protesters, and fired tear gas and live ammunition on peaceful demonstrators, killing more than 1,000 people in three weeks and arresting thousands of others. Yunus on Sunday said about 1,500 people were killed in the weeks of protests that brought down the Hasina government, adding that as many as 3,500 may have been forcibly abducted during her 15-year rule. He promised an investigation into all human rights violations, including alleged enforced disappearances while Hasina was in power. The interim leader said his administration will seek the extradition of the ousted prime minister from India, where she has been in exile since fleeing the student-led mass uprising in August. \u201cWe will seek the return of the fallen autocrat Sheikh Hasina from India,\u201d Yunus said. \u201cI have already discussed the issue with Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court Karim Khan.\u201d An arrest warrant has been issued for Hasina, 77, who fled to India via helicopter as demonstrators stormed her residence. She faces charges of \u201cmassacres, killings, and crimes against humanity\u201d and has been summoned to appear in a court in Dhaka. The extradition request could strain relations with India, a key regional ally that maintained close ties with Hasina throughout her tenure. \u201cWe should be able to resolve it amicably between India and Bangladesh,\u201d Yunus told Al Jazeera in an interview on the sidelines of the COP29 United Nations Climate Change Conference. \u201cWe draw attention to the Indian authorities that you are hosting her, that\u2019s fine, but please make sure she doesn\u2019t create problems for us.\u201d Yunus has been talking to political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party headed by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina\u2019s main rival, which has sought an election in two to three months. The party believes it will form the next government as Hasina\u2019s Awami League party and its allies face a political debacle following her ouster. \u201cAs we move forward, we need to complete a lot of work,\u201d Yunus said in his speech. \u201cThe train will reach its final station depending on how quickly we can lay down the railway tracks, and this will happen through consensus among the political parties.\u201d In his interview with Al Jazeera, Yunus acknowledged the challenges ahead. \u201cBangladesh is deep in corruption because of the system that we had for the past 15 years \u2013 mismanagement, misgovernance, the destruction of our institutions,\u201d he said, adding that rebuilding the system \u201cpoint by point, sector by sector\u201d will be a \u201cbig task\u201d. International Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean has called the challenge facing Yunus \u201cmonumental\u201d, warning that \u201ccracks are emerging in the fragile alliance\u201d that pushed him into power. \u201cFor now, Yunus and his colleagues have widespread support, but popular expectations are double-edged,\u201d the think tank said in a report on Thursday. \u201cIf the interim administration falters in making reforms, the outcome is likely to be an early election with little progress; in the worst-case scenario, the military could assume power.\u201d     "
